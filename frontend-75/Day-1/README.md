**Problem:** Debounce(https://www.greatfrontend.com/interviews/study/gfe75/questions/javascript/debounce)
**Goal:**
This Problem is about implementation of debounce function.

    Debounce function helps to run a function after certain timeout. **Debouce** function should have flush, cancel.
    **Cancel** should cancel delayed timeout and **flush** to invoke the pending function

**Approach:**

- To create debounce function First check if the func variable is typeof func
- Store the latest argument and context for invocation
- Use a timer to delay function execution
- Support immediate execution with the leading option
- Support delayed execution with the trailing option
- Clear previous timers bfore starting new one
- Provide a cancel method to abort pending execution
- Provide flush method to immediatly invoke pending calls]
- Return the last result fromt he debounced function
- Export for both ES modules and COmmon JS compatibility

**Code:**

```javascript
// Your code here

    **invoke**
    if (timeout) clearTimeout(timeout);
        timeout = setTimeout(() => {
        timeout = null;
        if (trailing && lastArgs) {
            return invoke();
        }
        }, wait);

    **Cancel**
    if (timeout) {
      clearTimeout(timeout);
      timeout = null;
    }
    lastArgs = lastThis = null;

    **Flush**
    if (timeout && lastArgs) {
      clearTimeout(timeout);
      timeout = null;
      return invoke();
    }
    return result;
```

// Example inputs and outputs
âœ“ Should call the functiononly once after rapid calls
âœ“ Should call the function immediately if leading is true
âœ“ Shuld cancel the debounced function
âœ“ Should flush the debounced function
âœ“ Should handle options correctly
âœ“ Should throw an error if the first argument is not a function
âœ“ Should preserve this/args context

**What I Learned**

- How to implement a debounce function from scratch.
- The importance of validating input types for robust code.
- Managing timers and function context in JavaScript.
- How `leading` and `trailing` options affect debounce behavior.
- Techniques to cancel or immediately invoke pending debounced calls.
- Writing utility methods (`cancel`, `flush`) for better API design.
- Handling edge cases and ensuring correct function invocation.
- Exporting modules for both ES and CommonJS compatibility.
- Writing and running Jest tests for timing-based functions.
- Debugging and refining code based on test results.
